                        <p>
                        <ul>Sales and Orders: The system records sales transactions, generates invoices, and keeps a
                            record of customer orders.

                        <ul>User Authentication: The system may include user authentication to restrict access to
                            authorized personnel.
                            User-Friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) offers an intuitive and
                            user-friendly way to interact with the system.</ul>
                        </p>
